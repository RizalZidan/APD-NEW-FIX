# Augmentation hyperparameters for training (YOLOv8 hyp format)
# Note: some augmentations (blur, noise, crop) are not standard keys
# in Ultralytics hyp but included here for clarity. For those, use
# an Albumentations pipeline or a custom dataloader transform.

degrees: 90.0        # rotation range in degrees (±90)
translate: 0.1

hsv_s: 0.7
hsv_v: 0.4          # brightness variation

# Non-standard / reference probabilities (use Albumentations for full support)
blur: 0.2           # probability to apply blur (Gaussian/median)
noise: 0.2          # probability to add random noise
crop: 0.2           # probability to apply random crop

# Example notes:
# - To use this hyp file with Ultralytics YOLOv8 CLI: `--hyp hyp.yaml`.
# - For blur/noise/crop, integrate Albumentations in a custom dataset transform.
